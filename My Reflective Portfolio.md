# *Reflection* - 

# *Week 1:*
During week 1, I have learnt about my teachers and classmates. We did a Mural activity which required you to showcase a little bit about yourself. This was a good activity as I got to learn about the people around me and who I was going to be working with for the semester.  I also found people who had similar interests and hobbies as me which allowed me to connect with some peers. 

### *What did I learn:*
Today I learned about systems. There are many different ways to define a system as nearly everything is a system. Systems comprise a boundary, elements within the boundary and the interactions between each element. A system requires each part to work independently together to perform as a whole function. There are three different types of systems which are categorised as the following:
 - Open system 
 - Closed system
 - Isolated system 
 - Each system is influenced by its environment and surroundings to transfer information, energy or matter across.

A complicated system is different to a complex system as they both have similar yet slightly different characteristics.

I also learnt that there are different levels of complexity within systems which are based upon the amount of lines of codes required to develop the system. 
 - Micro - Static and dynamic  complexity 
 - Macro - Genetic complexity 

Another thing I learnt was that Complex Systems adapt! These systems adapt through evolving to match the society, situation and environment they are in. There are many ways a system can do this like:
 - Distributed control
 - No equilibrium
 - Connectivity
 - Constantly changing 

A complex system usually comprises technical and social components known as Socio-Technical Systems. Social systems include interaction with individuals, interdependent interactions with meaning and unity whilst Technical systems include software and hardware which are not self-aware (processes and operators not considered a part of the system). Socio-Technical systems are usually owned and run by organisations with policies, rules and regulations. 

## *Why learn about systems:*
It is important to learn about systems because they are an explanation of how the world works. They allow for us to understand and see a model of phenomas and how the world works. Systems can be mathematical, political, interstellar, ecological, human or environmental. Most of the time a system is physical or abstract. 
Systems are important as it shows inputs and outputs between the elements within a system. This can deepen our understanding of how the world around us works and teach us to think innovatively and creatively. Social and technical aspects display to us that they are interdependent and interconnected with each other; which effectively recognises that a complex system requires a human element and a technical element which are continuously interacting with one another. 

## *What is already known:*
Systems were already known about in the study of science and technology. However, this lesson has shown that systems are everywhere and as humans we adhere to that. In society, systems allow for a structure to lifestyle and health. It is a little difficult to come to terms with as there is such a broad spectrum of systems and to understand them all will take time. In 1968, Ludwig Von Bertalanffy explained The General Systems Theory (GST) which explained complex systems that can be mathematically modelled. With consideration to this theory, the learning of systems throughout the week has been beneficial to increase my understanding about systems. Many systems have multiple components which work towards a common purpose or goal. At times there goals are altered to better fit within the environment they are in; evolve. There are so many aspects to systems and how they can do better for the human world and how if we enhance their capabilities, we can uncover new technologies and ideologies about the world around us. On a global scale systems have been widely accepted even if others did not know it existed in the first place. The study introduction of systems has been very interesting and insightful to me. 

# *My Learning in action:*
## *Examples of system:*
Transport systems
The evolution of transport systems have been showcased on a global scale. We started out with walking on foot, to horse drawn carriages, boats, to the first automobile, plane and virtual. Along the way we have specialised and invented new technologies which allow us to travel from one place to another in the most efficient way. “It’s all about the experience”. Travel has become an integral part of life and without it, the economy would decay and decrease in jobs. Transportation systems optimise resources which benefit humans to the highest possible extent; most favourable outcome. Complex systems within transportation include 
Rail (people, train, railroad, platforms, gravel/rocks, tickets, stations, cables, signals/lights, seats > all play a role within the rail system)
Air (people, plane, runways, terminals, tickets, lights, luggage, vehicles, turf, airport, jet bridge, staircase > all play a role within the air system)
Road (people, cars, bus, trucks, vehicles, line markings, lights, signals, crossings, signs > all play roles within the road system).

# *Reflecting on my Learning:*
## *What insights have I gained?*
A system requires human interaction to work. Systems in society merge together with technology known as socio-technical systems. These systems are the basis of modern society and how we live and operate our daily lives. Most of the time we do not pay close attention to the systems around us and that is because it has become embedded in ourselves; a norm. There are certain roles and responsibilities of both humans and systems so ensure organisations, companies and individuals work together in a cohesive manner and sustainable environment. Each level of complexity within a system is added through new knowledge and a broader understanding of how our society interacts.

#### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
#### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
#### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
#### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?



# *Week 2: Reflecting on my learning*

### *What insights have I gained?*
Dynamic Complexity is all about the multiple dimensions of a problem and systematically testing them with conditions to collect data on their interactions. To do this, modelling has been adapted in today's society with the following six premises:
 - Building blocks 
 - Surprises
 - Examples from many disciplines
 - Interdisciplinary modelling
 - Everyone can benefit from models
 - No advanced mathematical backgrounds needed

An inclusion of all these premises can lead to a good model. The concept of Parsimony is important during the process of model thinking. It means the best model is always that which achieves the greatest realism with the least parameter complexity and the least model complexity. Realism and abstraction play key roles in modelling. 
Another aspect of modeling is capturing observations. Most people like to visualize and play around with a computer rather than be in the field. Being in the field is a lot more laborious, intense and  time consuming but with modelling it is faster and people are able to test many different conditions, analyse and collect data quicker. 

As well as using technology, modelling requires a mental side. Using your mind is important when determining the models one will create. Interpretation of physical ideas can differ from person to person. These are what we call biases. There are always going to be flaws in our thinking and with our systemic approach to problem solving, so being aware of biases can help to reduce issues within models. Mental assumptions are also based on one’s beliefs and values which motivate our decisions. 

There are so many reasons why we model. We model to reason, explain, design, communicate, act, predict and explore the world around us. Three different models used for many model thinkers are: 
 - Embodiment Approach
 - Analogy Approach
 - Alternative Reality 

These models come from the model thinking workflow: 
 - Real Word > Simplified World > Model > Scenario. 

To have a better understanding about many model thinking, it's important to understand the basics. The wisdom hierarchy gives a good representation to assist many model thinking. In this hierarchy there are four components which are,
 - Data: Raw, uncoded events, experiences, and phenomena
 - Information: Names and partitions data into categories
 - Knowledge: Understandings of correlative, causal, and logical relationships > MODEL FORM 
 - Wisdom: Ability to identify and apply relevant knowledge > MANY MODEL THINKING

Wisdom comes in many forms but with many model thinking it comes from crowds. Working in a collaborative environment with many different people, all with different skill sets, the models become versatile and adaptive. Wisdom in crowds can build up logical plans and spread out outcomes. To gain a scope of perspectives on problems. Key aspects of wisdom include,
 - Diversity
 - Local knowledge
 - Independence
 - Aggregation 
A collective judgement and analysis on problems and also shows that no single person can answer all questions associated with the issue.

# *Week 3: Reflecting on my learning*

### *What insights have I gained?*
Models are heavily influenced by people - the human aspect. It’s important to understand how and why we impact systems and this can be investigated in three models: 
- Rational: People behave to optimise their goals
- Behavioural: Observing how people behave 
- Rule based: Using psychology to predict how people behave

Rational Models:

Behavioural Models:

Rule Based Models:

Now with the understanding of how to analyse behaviour of individuals, we investigate why people make decisions with models. There are two reason:
- Normative: Allow us to make better decisions
- Positive: Predict behaviour of others and why they make decisions

For decisions under uncertainty, models require probability. There are three types of probability:
- Classical: Mathematical sense
- Frequency: Number of specific outcomes
- Subjective: Guessing and estimating 
- Along with uncertainty, decision trees are a technique that offer assistance when there are a lot of outcomes and it can be used to see how others perceive issues and ideas. 

![image of decision tree](https://miro.medium.com/max/1024/1*-8tqsBEjsEW6wMFxczD5uQ.png)


Often when analysing decision making of people, we need to know what information is meaningful. Value of Information (VoI) is a decisions analysis technique which allows a decision maker to improve the choices they make. By doing VoI, we can learn more about biases and compare the information with pre-existing knowledge and theories. 

Signaling models are used to identify conditions in which people reveal information purposely. Within these models, people display information that they want others to know of, such as particular traits or materialistic objects. This is known as conspicuous consumption. 


There are two signalling models which are reliant on cost: 
- discrete signaling model: Choose to send a signal or not.
- continuous signaling model: Signal size varies.

Value and power are reliant on contribution. There are three ways to capture contribution:
- Cooperative game: Seeks coalition of people within a group
- Last-on-the-bus (LOTB) value: value of the last person
- Shapley value: Marginal contribution when a person is added to a coalition 

The Shapely satisfies the following conditions: 
- Efficiency: The sum of the values.
- Fairness/Symmetry: The same added value for any coalition means same value. 
- Additivity: Value is equal to version 1 and 2 combined.
- Zero property: If a value equals zero for any coalition.

Problem solving in groups requires four steps before you find innovation. 
- Perspectives: Looking at problems in many dimensions.
- Heuristics: Finding solutions
- Team Diversity: Combine perspectives and heuristics to find the best solutions.
- Recomincation: Combining perspectives and heuristics to increase perspectives and heuristics.
