# *Reflection* - 

## *Week 1:*
During week 1, I have learnt about my teachers and classmates. We did a Mural activity which required you to showcase a little bit about yourself. This was a good activity as I got to learn about the people around me and who I was going to be working with for the semester.  I also found people who had similar interests and hobbies as me which allowed me to connect with some peers. 

### *What did I learn:*
Today I learned about systems. There are many different ways to define a system as nearly everything is a system. Systems comprise a boundary, elements within the boundary and the interactions between each element. A system requires each part to work independently together to perform as a whole function. There are three different types of systems which are categorised as the following:
Open system 
Closed system
Isolated system 
Each system is influenced by its environment and surroundings to transfer information, energy or matter across.

A complicated system is different to a complex system as they both have similar yet slightly different characteristics.

I also learnt that there are different levels of complexity within systems which are based upon the amount of lines of codes required to develop the system. 
Micro - Static and dynamic  complexity 
Macro - Genetic complexity 

Another thing I learnt was that Complex Systems adapt! These systems adapt through evolving to match the society, situation and environment they are in. There are many ways a system can do this like:
Distributed control
No equilibrium
Connectivity
Constantly changing 

A complex system usually comprises technical and social components known as Socio-Technical Systems. Social systems include interaction with individuals, interdependent interactions with meaning and unity whilst Technical systems include software and hardware which are not self-aware (processes and operators not considered a part of the system). Socio-Technical systems are usually owned and run by organisations with policies, rules and regulations. 

## *Why learn about systems:*
It is important to learn about systems because they are an explanation of how the world works. They allow for us to understand and see a model of phenomas and how the world works. Systems can be mathematical, political, interstellar, ecological, human or environmental. Most of the time a system is physical or abstract. 
Systems are important as it shows inputs and outputs between the elements within a system. This can deepen our understanding of how the world around us works and teach us to think innovatively and creatively. Social and technical aspects display to us that they are interdependent and interconnected with each other; which effectively recognises that a complex system requires a human element and a technical element which are continuously interacting with one another. 

## *What is already known:*
Systems were already known about in the study of science and technology. However, this lesson has shown that systems are everywhere and as humans we adhere to that. In society, systems allow for a structure to lifestyle and health. It is a little difficult to come to terms with as there is such a broad spectrum of systems and to understand them all will take time. In 1968, Ludwig Von Bertalanffy explained The General Systems Theory (GST) which explained complex systems that can be mathematically modelled. With consideration to this theory, the learning of systems throughout the week has been beneficial to increase my understanding about systems. Many systems have multiple components which work towards a common purpose or goal. At times there goals are altered to better fit within the environment they are in; evolve. There are so many aspects to systems and how they can do better for the human world and how if we enhance their capabilities, we can uncover new technologies and ideologies about the world around us. On a global scale systems have been widely accepted even if others did not know it existed in the first place. The study introduction of systems has been very interesting and insightful to me.

## *Examples of system:*
Transport systems
The evolution of transport systems have been showcased on a global scale. We started out with walking on foot, to horse drawn carriages, boats, to the first automobile, plane and virtual. Along the way we have specialised and invented new technologies which allow us to travel from one place to another in the most efficient way. “It’s all about the experience”. Travel has become an integral part of life and without it, the economy would decay and decrease in jobs. Transportation systems optimise resources which benefit humans to the highest possible extent; most favourable outcome. Complex systems within transportation include 
Rail (people, train, railroad, platforms, gravel/rocks, tickets, stations, cables, signals/lights, seats > all play a role within the rail system)
Air (people, plane, runways, terminals, tickets, lights, luggage, vehicles, turf, airport, jet bridge, staircase > all play a role within the air system)
Road (people, cars, bus, trucks, vehicles, line markings, lights, signals, crossings, signs > all play roles within the road system).
