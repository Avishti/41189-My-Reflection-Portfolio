# *Reflection* - 

# *Week 1:*
During week 1, I have learnt about my teachers and classmates. We did a Mural activity which required you to showcase a little bit about yourself. This was a good activity as I got to learn about the people around me and who I was going to be working with for the semester.  I also found people who had similar interests and hobbies as me which allowed me to connect with some peers. 

### *What did I learn:*
Today I learned about systems. There are many different ways to define a system as nearly everything is a system. Systems comprise a boundary, elements within the boundary and the interactions between each element. A system requires each part to work independently together to perform as a whole function. There are three different types of systems which are categorised as the following:
 - Open system 
 - Closed system
 - Isolated system 
 - Each system is influenced by its environment and surroundings to transfer information, energy or matter across.

A complicated system is different to a complex system as they both have similar yet slightly different characteristics. 
![Image of Table Comparison of Complicated and Complex Systems](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Allan_Best/publication/287680595/figure/tbl1/AS:669044415934468@1536524027613/1-Differences-between-simple-or-complicated-and-complex-systems-adapted-from-Finegood.png)

I also learnt that there are different levels of complexity within systems which are based upon the amount of lines of codes required to develop the system. 
 - Micro - Static and dynamic  complexity 
 - Macro - Genetic complexity 

Another thing I learnt was that Complex Systems adapt! These systems adapt through evolving to match the society, situation and environment they are in. There are many ways a system can do this like:
 - Distributed control
 - No equilibrium
 - Connectivity
 - Constantly changing 

A complex system usually comprises technical and social components known as Socio-Technical Systems. Social systems include interaction with individuals, interdependent interactions with meaning and unity whilst Technical systems include software and hardware which are not self-aware (processes and operators not considered a part of the system). Socio-Technical systems are usually owned and run by organisations with policies, rules and regulations. 

## *Why learn about systems:*
It is important to learn about systems because they are an explanation of how the world works. They allow for us to understand and see a model of phenomas and how the world works. Systems can be mathematical, political, interstellar, ecological, human or environmental. Most of the time a system is physical or abstract. 
Systems are important as it shows inputs and outputs between the elements within a system. This can deepen our understanding of how the world around us works and teach us to think innovatively and creatively. Social and technical aspects display to us that they are interdependent and interconnected with each other; which effectively recognises that a complex system requires a human element and a technical element which are continuously interacting with one another. 

## *What is already known:*
Systems were already known about in the study of science and technology. However, this lesson has shown that systems are everywhere and as humans we adhere to that. In society, systems allow for a structure to lifestyle and health. It is a little difficult to come to terms with as there is such a broad spectrum of systems and to understand them all will take time. In 1968, Ludwig Von Bertalanffy explained The General Systems Theory (GST) which explained complex systems that can be mathematically modelled. With consideration to this theory, the learning of systems throughout the week has been beneficial to increase my understanding about systems. Many systems have multiple components which work towards a common purpose or goal. At times there goals are altered to better fit within the environment they are in; evolve. There are so many aspects to systems and how they can do better for the human world and how if we enhance their capabilities, we can uncover new technologies and ideologies about the world around us. On a global scale systems have been widely accepted even if others did not know it existed in the first place. The study introduction of systems has been very interesting and insightful to me. 

# *My Learning in action:*
## *Examples of system:*
Transport systems
The evolution of transport systems have been showcased on a global scale. We started out with walking on foot, to horse drawn carriages, boats, to the first automobile, plane and virtual. Along the way we have specialised and invented new technologies which allow us to travel from one place to another in the most efficient way. “It’s all about the experience”. Travel has become an integral part of life and without it, the economy would decay and decrease in jobs. Transportation systems optimise resources which benefit humans to the highest possible extent; most favourable outcome. Complex systems within transportation include 
Rail (people, train, railroad, platforms, gravel/rocks, tickets, stations, cables, signals/lights, seats > all play a role within the rail system)
Air (people, plane, runways, terminals, tickets, lights, luggage, vehicles, turf, airport, jet bridge, staircase > all play a role within the air system)
Road (people, cars, bus, trucks, vehicles, line markings, lights, signals, crossings, signs > all play roles within the road system).

# *Reflecting on my Learning:*
## *What insights have I gained?*
A system requires human interaction to work. Systems in society merge together with technology known as socio-technical systems. These systems are the basis of modern society and how we live and operate our daily lives. Most of the time we do not pay close attention to the systems around us and that is because it has become embedded in ourselves; a norm. There are certain roles and responsibilities of both humans and systems so ensure organisations, companies and individuals work together in a cohesive manner and sustainable environment. Each level of complexity within a system is added through new knowledge and a broader understanding of how our society interacts. 




# *Week 2: Reflecting on my learning*

### *What insights have I gained?*
Dynamic Complexity is all about the multiple dimensions of a problem and systematically testing them with conditions to collect data on their interactions. To do this, modelling has been adapted in today's society with the following six premises:
 - Building blocks 
 - Surprises
 - Examples from many disciplines
 - Interdisciplinary modelling
 - Everyone can benefit from models
 - No advanced mathematical backgrounds needed

An inclusion of all these premises can lead to a good model. The concept of Parsimony is important during the process of model thinking. It means the best model is always that which achieves the greatest realism with the least parameter complexity and the least model complexity. Realism and abstraction play key roles in modelling. 
Another aspect of modeling is capturing observations. Most people like to visualize and play around with a computer rather than be in the field. Being in the field is a lot more laborious, intense and  time consuming but with modelling it is faster and people are able to test many different conditions, analyse and collect data quicker. 

As well as using technology, modelling requires a mental side. Using your mind is important when determining the models one will create. Interpretation of physical ideas can differ from person to person. These are what we call biases. There are always going to be flaws in our thinking and with our systemic approach to problem solving, so being aware of biases can help to reduce issues within models. Mental assumptions are also based on one’s beliefs and values which motivate our decisions. 

There are so many reasons why we model. We model to reason, explain, design, communicate, act, predict and explore the world around us. Three different models used for many model thinkers are: 
 - Embodiment Approach
 - Analogy Approach
 - Alternative Reality 

These models come from the model thinking workflow: 
 - Real Word > Simplified World > Model > Scenario. 

To have a better understanding about many model thinking, it's important to understand the basics. The wisdom hierarchy gives a good representation to assist many model thinking. In this hierarchy there are four components which are,
 - Data: Raw, uncoded events, experiences, and phenomena
 - Information: Names and partitions data into categories
 - Knowledge: Understandings of correlative, causal, and logical relationships > MODEL FORM 
 - Wisdom: Ability to identify and apply relevant knowledge > MANY MODEL THINKING

Wisdom comes in many forms but with many model thinking it comes from crowds. Working in a collaborative environment with many different people, all with different skill sets, the models become versatile and adaptive. Wisdom in crowds can build up logical plans and spread out outcomes. To gain a scope of perspectives on problems. Key aspects of wisdom include,
 - Diversity
 - Local knowledge
 - Independence
 - Aggregation 
A collective judgement and analysis on problems and also shows that no single person can answer all questions associated with the issue. 



# *Week 3: Reflecting on my learning*

### *What insights have I gained?*
Models are heavily influenced by people - the human aspect. It’s important to understand how and why we impact systems and this can be investigated in three models: 
- Rational: People behave to optimise their goals
- Behavioural: Observing how people behave 
- Rule based: Using psychology to predict how people behave

Rational Models: 

![image of rational models](https://img.favpng.com/21/18/12/rational-planning-model-decision-making-models-irrationality-png-favpng-vaFPxVQRaF1L4y46ENGhXBRvZ.jpg)

Behavioural Models: 

![image of behavioural modesl](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Liana_Luzzi/publication/5407720/figure/fig1/AS:203164809732104@1425449673475/Theory-of-Planned-Behaviour-Ajzen-1991.png)

Rule Based Models:

![image of rule based models](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Patricia_Rogers/publication/230557767/figure/fig1/AS:349441753141252@1460324814500/A-Simple-Logic-Model-W-K-Kellogg-Foundation-2004.png)


Now with the understanding of how to analyse behaviour of individuals, we investigate why people make decisions with models. There are two reason:
- Normative: Allow us to make better decisions
- Positive: Predict behaviour of others and why they make decisions

For decisions under uncertainty, models require probability. There are three types of probability:
- Classical: Mathematical sense
- Frequency: Number of specific outcomes
- Subjective: Guessing and estimating 
- Along with uncertainty, decision trees are a technique that offer assistance when there are a lot of outcomes and it can be used to see how others perceive issues and ideas. 

![image of decision tree](https://miro.medium.com/max/1024/1*-8tqsBEjsEW6wMFxczD5uQ.png)


Often when analysing decision making of people, we need to know what information is meaningful. Value of Information (VoI) is a decisions analysis technique which allows a decision maker to improve the choices they make. By doing VoI, we can learn more about biases and compare the information with pre-existing knowledge and theories. 

Signaling models are used to identify conditions in which people reveal information purposely. Within these models, people display information that they want others to know of, such as particular traits or materialistic objects. This is known as conspicuous consumption. 


There are two signalling models which are reliant on cost: 
- discrete signaling model: Choose to send a signal or not.
- continuous signaling model: Signal size varies.

Value and power are reliant on contribution. There are three ways to capture contribution:
- Cooperative game: Seeks coalition of people within a group
- Last-on-the-bus (LOTB) value: value of the last person
- Shapley value: Marginal contribution when a person is added to a coalition 

The Shapely satisfies the following conditions: 
- Efficiency: The sum of the values.
- Fairness/Symmetry: The same added value for any coalition means same value. 
- Additivity: Value is equal to version 1 and 2 combined.
- Zero property: If a value equals zero for any coalition.

Problem solving in groups requires four steps before you find innovation. 
- Perspectives: Looking at problems in many dimensions.
- Heuristics: Finding solutions
- Team Diversity: Combine perspectives and heuristics to find the best solutions.
- Recomincation: Combining perspectives and heuristics to increase perspectives and heuristics.



# *Week 4: Reflecting on my learning*

### *What insights have I gained?*
System Dynamics allow for a system to be analysed which provide feedback on the relationships between the system and its surroundings. Each of the interactions can be assessed through positive and negative feedback to increase our logical thinking. To do this, we look at each of the six dynamics:
- Sources: Inputs
- Sinks: Outputs
- Stocks: Variables
- Flows: Feedback 
- Rates: Level of Change between Variables
- Constants: Fixed or Changed Variables
Complexity can arise from both positive and negative feedback and through this, it can be identifiable. Taking this into consideration, we can gain detailed, dynamic and divergent perspectives of the world around us. As said in week 1, a system comprises a boundary, elements within the boundary and the interactions between each element. A system will always be changing and adapting to its circumstances and environment. 
Systems are defined by their interrelationships and their functionality or potential.
Thinking in systems relies on understanding boundaries. To define a system boundary one should look at its function, purpose and potential.

![Image of system thinking](https://kindling.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Systems-thinking.png)

Methodology of System Thinking:
1.  Define the boundary
2.  Identify macro and micro elements
3.  Change the perspectives
4.  Investigate further

Causal Loop Diagrams represent the relationship between variables. There are different signs which represent relationships between variables. These known as link polarities which include:
- ‘+’ increase
- ‘S’ Same relationship
- ‘O’ Opposite relationship
Loop Identifiers how the loop evolves overtime. These include:
- ‘B’ self balancing (odd amount of loops highly likely to be B)
- ‘R’ self reinforcing 

There are 3 Fundamental Modes of Interaction between loops. 
1. Exponential Growth: In ‘R’ loops when a variable is isolated shows Exp. Growth.
2. Goal-Seeking: A system naturally reaches its desired state. Comparisons between the actual state of the system and the goal.
3. Oscillation: Time delays (Administrative delays, action delays, measurement delays). Delays anywhere in the system will cause oscillations.

For each diagram system there is a mathematical writing. These are known as Lotka-Volterra equations. These equations have an equilibrium of extinction (-) and an interior (+) equilibrium (in relation to animal kingdoms).
 
Networks allow data to be turned into useful information and have become very popular over the years. 
Network structures are made of nodes and edges. A node is an individual entity and an edge can be directed or undirected which either point or do not point to other nodes. 

![Image of networks](https://w0.pngwave.com/png/560/823/rhizome-distributed-networking-computer-network-diagram-node-network-structure-png-clip-art.png)

There are four measures of structures: 
1. Degree: the amount of edges a node consists of.
2. Path length: length from node to node by counting the edges.
3. Connectedness: If the graph/diagram is connected to itself. 
4. Clustering Coefficient: The tightness and closeness of edges.

Logic of Network Formation occurs in three different ways:
1. Random: no structure between nodes and edges.
2. Small worlds: Nodes connect to themselves close by and some further away.
3. Preferential attachment: describes the internet. You connect to nodes which are more connected.

Network Function arises if there is some structure to a network. When nodes interact they mostly think about themselves, but when these preferences interact on the microlevel, they can lead to emergent properties or functionalities on the macro level.




# *Week 5: Reflecting on my learning*

### *What insights have I gained?*
Probability Distributions is a function which shows all possible values that a random variable can take. Aggregation looks at the formation of clusters of specific values and if often grouped in a non-linear way. When aggregation is analysed for the interactions within a group which can show new properties within the values. 
In probability, numbers range from 0 to 1 when you take all possibilities in consideration. Adding up each probability for an event will always equal 1. 

![image of probability](https://www.montereyinstitute.org/courses/DevelopmentalMath/COURSE_TEXT2_RESOURCE/U08_L4_T1_text_final_3_files/image001.gif)

A random variable is a variable that is subject to random variations so that it can take on multiple different values, each with an associated probability. A random variable consists of a collection of all possible values which results in data collection and used for analysis. Each probability has different levels of complexity, therefore not all can be reliable. A random variable changes with context therefore a good idea is to do sampling as different results may occur overtime. 

![image of distributions](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/probabilitydistribution2-150117052555-conversion-gate01/95/probability-distribution-2-20-638.jpg?cb=1421494059)

Probability distributions models allow for predictions to be made about random variables, data sets and their behaviours. 
Statistics and probability go hand in hand with each other. Statistics is the study of data via mathematical measures while understanding the parameters. Inferring the data can be done in three ways:
	1. Point estimation 
	2. Interval estimation
	3. Hypothesis testing 

Regularity refers to normal distributions in a bell-shaped curve. This means that the scores are symmetric and the mean, median and mode are equal. These curves usually have high accuracy. 

The Central Limit Theorem is a simple and effective model of aggregation in groups of people. Each agent makes an independent decision which will be analysed through statistical measures. This theorem states that if you add up all independent variables, the end result will be a bell curve or Gaussian Distribution. If the independent variables are not added together and averaged, then the curve will not be normally distributed. 
The tail of the curve depends on the variance and random variables added together. If there is low variance the tail will be short, and high variance the tail will be long. 

Long tail distributions have extremes which is known as the power law. A Power Law is present when the distribution is top-heavy with a long tail. Stated in other words, it is a system where large is rare and small is common. These long tails have independence. A power law can be defined by the function:
y = C x − α
Both c and α (is the scaling parameter and determines the slope of the distribution) are the constants characterising the power law distribution.The special case of power laws with exponents equal to 2 are known as Zipf distributions.Zipf's law — For power-law distributions with an exponent of 2 (α=2) the rank of the event times its size equals a constant: Event Rank x Event Size= Constant. 

2 Models that produce power laws include: 
 1. Preferential attachment: Assists with the explanations of why power laws are linked. 
 2. Self organised criticality: builds interdependencies in a system until the system reaches a critical state.

Linear models describe a continuous response variable in the form of linear regression. It shows the relationship between independent and dependent variables. A vertical offset is a difference between actual and predicted data. Linear regression provides the following information:
- Sign: +/-, correlation
- Significance: p-value 
- Magnitude: estimate of the coefficient

When there are multiple variables, a multiple-variable linear regression can be used. Although regression cannot prove patterns and causes, they can help with explanations. 

With all this in mind, it is important to understand the limitations of these models and mathematical measures. 



# *Week 6: Reflecting on my learning*

### *What insights have I gained?*
Path dependence occurs through the choices and methodologies of previous actions. The probability of the outcomes from the actions is what is path dependent. It can be sensitive to initial conditions and is tested through changing the actions of a system. To investigate and understand path dependencies, an urn model is used. These models allow distinction between processes and elements of a system that either are or aren't path dependent. 

The bernoulli principle and urn models go hand in hand to look at which outcomes with probability between 0 (unlikely) and 1 (likely). Two distinctions one can get from using this model is, 1.Path dependence: outcome probabilities depend upon the sequence of past outcomes and 2.Excellent (phat) dependence: outcome probabilities depend upon past outcomes but not their order. Another process used to help look at path dependencies is with the polya process. This process does not look at the order of the outcomes but rather the probability specifically. It compares against the equilibrium. 

Similar to the Markov process which converges to a stochastic equilibrium, the Markov processes are not path dependent because the transition probabilities are fixed. There are three Markov assumptions: 
1. Finite states with fixed transition probabilities between all states
2. All states are obtainable from any other state
3. Are not constricted to a simple periodic cycle
The Markov process assesses the move of a system from one state to another. The states are usually predefined and these certain entities move within. It is independent. 

As said previously, sensitivity of outcomes is known chaos. Path dependence looks at the affect. 
1. Independent: Outcome doesn’t depend on starting point or what happens along the way
2. Initial conditions: Outcome depends on starting state
3. Path dependent: Outcome probabilities depend upon the sequence of past outcomes
4. Phat dependence: Outcome probabilities depend upon past outcomes but not their order.
This displays that sequence can matter and influence the probability of outcomes. 

Path dependence can also be associated with increasing returns. Returns refers to the strength of a certain outcome in regards to the equilibrium and variations. You cannot have increasing returns without a path dependence, thus this property is essential for finding out if outcomes have a path. 

Random walks are models where the probability of ½, or binary walks. Random normal walks consist of x=0, a normal distribution and a standard deviation of 1. Finite memory walks consist of the idea that the value at time t depends on the cumulative value of the history before time t, also known as n. 
In general, random walks show the following:
- there is a distinction between luck and skill
- there is paradox of skill at high skill levels
- there is regression to the mean in random walks
- the stock market has some randomness to it in the short term

A random walk is not path dependent
Non Linear models and functions rely on concavity and convexity. Convexity occurs from growth and positive feedback and concavity comes from negative feedback and returns. 

![image of concave and convex](https://i.stack.imgur.com/GNBZ4.png)

Convex is an increase in the slope and concave is the opposite; to decrease.

Exponential growth models show the variables of the population as a function of the initial value. 

![Image of exponential equation](https://3g5opl996l.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/production/svg?tex=V_t%3DV_0%5Cleft(1%2BR%5Cright)%5Et)

Diminishing returns can explain some phenomenons. These are associated with concavity which can further imply diversity and risk aversion. 

![Image of returns](https://thepeakperformancecenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Law-of-Diminishing-Returns.jpg)

Risk aversion is implied through 3 outcome:
1. High
2. Low
3. Mean (Average)

While concavity shows risk aversion, convexity shows risk tolerance. 

To spread information models of percolation, riots, broadcast and diffusion.. These models are a key form of communication between society and technology. Many products, programs, ideas and information are spread by word of mouth or broadcast. 
1. Tipping point model: non linear with small changes creating big effects. 
2. Percolation: graphical with filled in or not squares.
3. Riots: Actions which aggravate variables and also model the whole distribution reactions.
4. Broadcast: television, media or radio models which spread information.
5. Diffusion: captures the word of mouth model with informed or uninformed.
 
Equilibrium Lyapunov functions map models to outcomes through definition of the system. The system could be chaotic, complex or simple. If the lyapunov function is there, then it is known the system is in an equilibrium or is changing in and out of the equilibrium state. It is dependent. 
The Lyapunov Process: has a maximum/minimum, and every time the system moves, it moves towards the maximum/minimum by a finite step. Then at some point the system must reach an equilibrium state.




# *Week 7: Reflecting on my learning*

### *What insights have I gained?*

Segregation model is based on widespread racial issues in the developed countries. Apart from racial discrimination, the segratation model is used to test other hypotheses. It can be considered a part of the behavioural models.

![image of Segregation model](https://marginalrevolution.com/photos/uncategorized/schelling.jpg)

Segregation model can be used to test the use of incentives within large groups. From research, it can be found that small incentives may not always have large outcomes. The outcomes rely on the connections between networks which can have two tipping points. 
1. Exodus tip: When one leaves, another leaves
2. Genesis tip: When one enters, another leaves. 

The Granovetter model is a threshold behavioural model which assumes the behaviour of an individual is reliant on a pre-existing number of people with that same behaviour. 
A factor that should be considered when modelling is culture. There is no set definition for culture as it is diverse and ever changing. They allow for the exploration of values of survival, expression, tradition and rationality. Culture can also be characterised in other ways like,
1. Power
2. Inequality
3. Individualism
4. Collectivism
5. Masculinity
6. Femininity
7. Dynamism

Coordination relies on the efficiency of choices. A coordination is efficient when the majority is benefited whilst inefficient coordination is when the majority is not benefited. As coordination goes, there must be a source of consistency. If coordination is not correct, then small changes or errors can have a big effect on the outcome.
Replicator models are a type of social learning model used in three disciplines. 
1. Psychology: to model learning
2. Economics: to model populations of people learning
3. Ecology: to model evolution

These types of models use proportional populations to either model success or failure of observed outcomes. A replication model has an equation with the following variables,
- Actions/strategies
- Payoff for each π(i)
- Specific proportion of population Pr(i)

Rationality is required when observing outcomes to assess the effect of the equilibrium. 

Fisher’s theorem allows for the combination of models in regards to the replicator models and lets variation play a role in adaptation of systems. In this theorem, Fisher states that higher variance is equal to faster rate of adaptation, but less variation reduces errors. 



# *Week 8: STUVAC*


# *Week 9: Reflecting on group work*

Throughout week 9 it has been very busy with the Pre-Submission due. There was a lot to do so organisation was key for the completion of the task. 

### *What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?*

The strengths that I found during the pre-submission task are my ability to be organised and on track. I would create a layout/outline for all of the answers so they can be answered correctly with the required detail. I also saw myself with good leadership skills to make sure everything was completed ahead of time and I had proofread all content. A weakness that I discovered was at times my group struggled with communication. 

### *What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?*

The challenges my team faced was not being able to be on group calls altogether. Due to the online nature of classes, many of our schedules did not align so having group meetings was difficult. To combat this issue, my team and I called in groups of two at a time with any important or key notes we had, would be written into the shared document we created. 

### *What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?*

Next time I would learn more about Github and Jupyter Notebook as I struggled to use them with the pre-submission. Learning more about these programs my group will be able to have more complex models and new skills to enhance the final report. 



# *Week 10: Reflecting on group work*

Throughout week 10 my group edited and reviewed our own assignment and group 3’s assignment. 

### *What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?*

I found that one of my strengths was that I was able to pick up on spelling and grammar mistakes. I was also able to change and fix any errors that I discovered through the work. A weakness I found it hard to understand and clarify some sections of work. 

### *What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?*

The challenges I faced this week was my group not contributing to the feedback and review. I had to do a lot of it alone and when I asked for their help they wouldn’t reply or leave one or two sentences (which wasn’t much compared to how much I did). I did try to talk to my group about the issue or contribution but no one responded so I am giving feedback alone still. 

### *What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?*

Next time I would contact someone of higher authority to get them to help me out with the issue of contribution and in turn this should solve the issue of myself having to write feedback without the help of my team members. 



# *Week 11: Reflecting on me*

Throughout week 11 my group took upon feedback and reviewed our assignment.

### *What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?*

This week I didn’t observe a strength but more a weakness. I struggled to understand Jupyter Notebook and create one properly. I struggled to understand what was meant to be done and found I did get annoyed and frustrated with myself. 

### *What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?*

The challenges I faced this week was to keep calm when I did not understand how to use the jupyter notebook very well. I had placed our assignment in a Read.me file instead of a Markdown file. I handled the situation well as I was patient and waited for the teachers assistance. 

### *What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?*

Next time I would try to ask earlier about the notebook and how to set it up. This would be done prior to the due date. By doing this, the final product will look a lot better and be in the correct format. 


# *Week 12: Reflecting on group work*

Throughout week 12 my group worked on fixing up section 3 of our assignment.

### *What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?*

My perceived strengths is that I was able to learn quickly about jupyter notebook even though I was struggling with it. I still am not confident but I know with practice I will do better. Using the notebook has definitely shown my weaker side of this subject. 

### *What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?*

The challenges I faced this week were a lack of communication between myself and group members. Being in an online situation is not the easiest and at times being in person with your team would benefit better. I handled the situation by completing all the work that needed to be done alone; taking initiative to complete the work. 

### *What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?*

Next time I would try to get into contact with my team members even though it is hard at times. By trying to do this the results may be a better written segment of writing. 


# *Week 13: Last reflection*

### *My Contribution to the project:*
During this assignment I helped out with many sections. The sections I primarily focused on were the 1- the introduction, context, background information, justification, section 3.1 and 3.2 - Conceptual Models, section 4 - implementation and section 5- scenario analysis for the segregation and culture model. 

### *Other group members contributions:*

Srinitya: Section 1 - context, background information, justification, section 5 - rule based, section 6 - proposed solutions, 
Chandra: Section 2, Section 3.3, section 5.1 - rule based and 5.2 sensitivity analysis, 
Samhitha: Section 2, Section 3.3, Section 5.1 scenario analysis.

Although these are specific areas, everyone contributed in editing, adding and re-reading sections. 

### *Positives from the project and what I learnt:*

The positives that I will be taking from this project is how I learnt to use new programs and applications. Using a jupyter notebook was new to me and getting my head around this new application has taught me new skills. I also learnt a lot more about python coding and how to re-use and edit pre-existing codes. Another positive from this experience is how to communicate and complete a project online with no face to face interactions. I learnt how to trust in my team and achieve an outcome that I am proud of. There has definitely been a lot of work put into this project and I hope that it is reflected in the assignment. I learnt a lot more about project management and trying to always be there to help my team members when they could not understand what to do or stepping in to assist with the completion of a section. One of the most important things I learnt was to dive into concepts that I wasn’t very familiar with and to try and learn and understand what I had to do. This is a skill I can definitely take into the real world, even after this unit and university. 


### *Challenges I faced and how did I overcame them:*

There were many challenges that I faced during this project. The first challenge was understanding how to use the jupyter notebook. I struggled to use the commands and how to add and delete cells at first and then struggled to push changes from the notebook to github. For 2 weeks the github kept corrupting as a file and I had to create multiple copies of the respiratory and move all information from the previous to the new. This was time-consuming and frustrating. To overcome this barrier, my group kept a google document of all the information so if the github were to stop working we wouldn’t lose any of our work. Another challenge was that I was the only person in my group who had access to the notebook so I was constantly uploading all our work whilst at the same time learning how to use the application. At times, this became difficult as I was trying to do a lot of things in such a small time whilst multitasking to help my group with anything they didn’t understand. To cope with this, I had to have good time-management. Another challenge I faced was explaining the sections my fellow group members had to do whilst also trying to complete my own sections. I took responsibility for a lot of the sections in the assignment as group leader but I never felt alone as my group was always there for me. To overcome this challenge, we had a lot of good teamwork and we were all supportive of one another. Also, challenges of re-writing whole sections was prevalent during the assignment. Section 3 and 4 were the most difficult and struggled with a lot. Many times, the feedback told us we had not hit the mark and had to research again. This was very time consuming and a little deflating. To overcome this, I always kept my head held high and a positive attitude with a growth mindset. There were so many challenges in the duration of this project and to come out of the other side with a near complete assignment shows that hard work and determination can really take you far, even if not everything is perfect. 

### *Real world modelling and the approach taken:*

Approaches on modelling depend on the problem at hand. With myself, I am always growing and learning new things and trying to place into practice what I learnt theoretically into the real world. Problems in everyday life such as choosing the cheapest and most genuine product in the supermarket depend on using models. A comparative model such as the segregation model can give me an output which shows what other picks when they go shopping and this would indicate to me that this is a trusted product as it is used by so many people. On the other hand, the segregation model will also show me people who do not choose the option that the majority did. From this, I can do comparative analysis of the situation and this will help me choose the best product for me, with evidence and judgement. Another scenario that models could be used in real world problems is seeing how the evolution of culture has modernised. By using Axelord’s Culture model it can be shown how people of different backgrounds have come together and adapted to the changing world. Each modelling approach really does depend on what one is looking for. If someone wanted to look at behaviour then using agent-based models would be the best option. However, if one wanted to look at how social events influence society, the best model to use would be networks as they use data which can provide information on how things connect together and how one thing may or may not link with another. Whatever model one choses, it will assist them with decision making. By using models, we can weigh each option in a scenario and use mathematics and logic to come up with a viable solution or choice.
